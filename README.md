## About

Example repo on how to use
[@wheelroom/wheelroom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wheelroom/wheelroom) and
[gatsby-theme-wheelroom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-theme-wheelroom)

## Required

This has been developed and tested on macOS. Ubuntu should not give any
problems. Windows has never been tried, there's possibly some unresolved path
issues there. I'd be happy to know.

The boilerplate depends on [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and uses
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

After every update we built and test a [Wheelroom demo
site](https://boilerplate.wheelroom.io/) on Netlify.
